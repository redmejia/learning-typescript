# Learning Typescript Basics
This Git repository provides a comprehensive tutorial designed to help JavaScript developers smoothly transition to TypeScript.

## What you'll learn:
- Introduction to TypeScript: Understand the fundamentals of TypeScript, its advantages over JavaScript, and how it empowers catching errors early and promoting better code organization.

- Type Basics: Learn declaring variables with explicit types like string, number, and boolean, and witness how TypeScript effectively prevents type mismatches.

- Interfaces: Explore the concept of interfaces, which define the structure of objects and ensure consistent data across your application.

- Functions with Types: Learn how to type function parameters and return values, emphasizing the importance of type safety in preventing unexpected behavior.

- Classes and Types: An introduction to classes. Discover how to utilize type annotations for properties and methods.

- Generics (Brief Introduction): Gain a glimpse into generics, a powerful feature enabling the creation of reusable components that work with various data types.

# What is TypeScript
Typescript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. In other words, any JavaScript code is valid Typescript code. However, TypeScript adds statics typing to the language, this means that you can specify types of variables, parameters and return values in your code.

in JavaScript, variables can hold values of any type, and the type can change during run time.Typescript introduce static typing, allowing to declare the type of variables, making it easier to catch and prevent certain types of errors during development. This can lead to more robust and maintainable code.
