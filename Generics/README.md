# Generics

In TypeScript, generics allow you to write code that can work with different types.

Think of generics as placeholders for data types. You define a function, class, or interface with a generic type variable, represented by letters like T, U, or K.

The echo function can only handle numbers, limiting its flexibility.
The echoGeneric function uses a generic type T, allowing it to work with any data type.
