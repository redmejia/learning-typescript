# Classes
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that all objects of that type will share.

The Person class in the explample could have properties (name, age), each annotated with its respective type.

The constructor initializes these properties when a new instance of the class is created.

The methods have type annotations for both parameters and the return value.
In the example below printName method return void type and personAge return number type
